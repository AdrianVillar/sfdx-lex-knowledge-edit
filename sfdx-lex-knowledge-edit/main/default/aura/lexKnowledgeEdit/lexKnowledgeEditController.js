Online students do not have a thesis option—they must complete all elective courses and the final program examination.</p> The exam is new each time.  In other words, the case study and assignment will not be re-used term to term.<br><br>Students will be provided study materials and the case study approximately one week before exam.  They will be given a required day and a time frame during that day to complete the exam (i.e., a 6-hour window to complete the 3-hour exam).  When they log into the class, the instructor will provide the exam.   Responses will be submitted via the drop box.   *Students may also take the exam on campus, if local or if they prefer to attend.*<br> <br><b><u>Final Program Examination FAQs</u></b><br> <br><b>How will this exam be facilitated or will it be offered online through our online classroom? Is it a part of one of the final classes or will it be separate exam taken after the completion of all courses?</b><br>The final program examination will be a special class in the online classroom, and the course will be built as CYB 0001 – Final Program Examination.  The academic department strongly <i>suggests they <b>take the exam the term after their last class, or by itself</b></i>, and not while in other classes.  However, taking the exam in the student’s final term with another course will be allowed by exception.<br> <br><b>Will it be pass/fail or will a letter grade be issued?</b><br>Exams are graded out of 100 points. Passing score is 70/100 or above.<br><br><b>How does it impact graduation if the student doesn’t pass? Can it be retaken a certain number of times?</b><br>The student must pass the exam to graduate.  They are allowed two attempts to pass the exam.  A third attempt may be allowed with an appeal. The exam needs to be completed to walk at commencement ceremony and receive a diploma.<br> <br><b>Will there be a cost to register for this exam?</b><br>There are no fees to take the comp exam.<br> <br><b>Will there be any type of preparation provided for the exam (i.e., study guides, prep lectures, etc.)?</b><br>There is a study guide prepared by the department for the students.  These are sent out to the students approximately 1 to 2 terms before the student enrolls in the last course.<br><br><b>Is there a deadline to register and complete this exam? </b><br>Students will need to be added manually to the exam section per term (since this will not be a class in the registration system).  Students can take it during their second-to-last term through the term after their last class (this will depend on when it is offered)." ;
